## Lockdown listening behaviour

As of 23 March 2020, The Netherlands went into lockdown.
Caf√©s, night-clubs, etc closed these places have an enormous impact on Record charts, how did the music in these charts change from that point on?

## Corpus
I will analyze the following playlists which are composed by the Dutch Top 40 organization:

 [Top 100 - 2020](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6s2oVTnYPWiOQ3NWeQXQi0?si=TIbk3pSJSkOyPo84Bgx0dg) **(Lockdown year)** \
 [Top 100 - 2019](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4GE2vQbmdOXyNO0emar1Na?si=i51cEa3FT4OEPppKxYmTnA) \
 [Top 100 - 2018](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7gwthBoLwD3pmNAddLghAf?si=3ANv5nUvTc6hyzGB8nI5Qw) \
 [Top 100 - 2017](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0UmGzufa2clHxFb1gyP5Vb?si=1_FPOEJiSpSgCLz7NCTcLQ) \
 [Top 100 - 2016](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2fi7vnsg3MlzRVMLzKmJLM?si=G1X_PDwOSEaozkNLWp4egw) \
 [Top 100 - 2015](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Vxi2dBccOTLRW7BPPg6EO?si=VIeVwOMCQlqkwNCVL6yTdw) \
 [Top 100 - 2014](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AWknWlwF23A9VJnHeYuAr?si=tKWAXhO8TumQoMTQAqwYdQ)

Total songs: 700

My expectation is that the average dance ability, energy of the top 100 tracks of 2020 will be significantly lower compared to the previous years.


### Corpus limitations
Since the lists are top 100 overviews of the full years instead of the individual top 40 lists for every week of the year, it might be possible that the differences are harder to capture.

### Typical tracks

The typical tracks for each playlist will be picked by, calculating the average audio feature values and finding the song which audio features are closest to this average.
